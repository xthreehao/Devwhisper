# 🎙️ DevWhisper — Voice-Native Developer Experience Agent



DevWhisper is a voice-first AI agent built for developers. Instead of stopping to search through files or documentation, you just ask out loud — and it answers based on your actual codebase.

## 🚨 The Problem



Developers lose focus constantly. Switching between your editor, a browser, Stack Overflow, and documentation breaks the flow of thinking. Most AI tools still require you to type, copy-paste code, and wait.



DevWhisper lets you stay in flow. Ask a question with your voice, get an answer in seconds, and keep coding.

## ✨ What It Does



🎤 You ask a question about your code

🔍 It searches your actual codebase semantically

🔊 It responds in plain spoken English, like a senior dev sitting next to you



Example questions that work:

- "What does the preprocess function do?"

- "Where is the model saved after training?"

- "How do I debug a KeyError in the pipeline?"

## 🛠️ Tech Stack



- 🎙️ Vapi — handles voice input and output

- 🗄️ Qdrant — stores and searches code as vectors

- 🤖 Groq with LLaMA 3.3 70B — generates the response

- ⚡ FastAPI — receives webhooks from Vapi and orchestrates everything

## 🚀 How To Run It



1. Clone this repo

2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Create a `.env` file in the root folder:`cp ./.env.example ./.env`

4. Add your Python files to the `sample\_codebase` folder

5. Index your codebase: `python indexer.py`

6. Start the server: `uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000`

7. Expose publicly: `ngrok http 8000`

8. Update Vapi tool Server URL with your ngrok URL plus `/webhook`

## 📁 Project Structure



- `main.py` — FastAPI webhook server, handles all Vapi events

- `indexer.py` — chunks your code files and uploads them to Qdrant

- `retriever.py` — takes a query and finds the most relevant code chunks

- `llm.py` — sends the query and context to Groq and returns the answer

- `sample\_codebase/` — put your own Python project files here



---



## ⚠️ Notes



- The ngrok URL changes every time you restart it. Remember to update the Server URL in your Vapi tool settings each time.

- The `.env` file is not included in this repo for security. You need to create your own with the keys above.
