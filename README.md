DevWhisper is a voice-first AI agent built for developers. Instead of stopping to search through files or documentation, you just ask out loud — and it answers based on your actual codebase.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Developers lose focus constantly. Switching between your editor, a browser, Stack Overflow, and documentation breaks the flow of thinking. Most AI tools still require you to type, copy-paste code, and wait.

DevWhisper lets you stay in flow. Ask a question with your voice, get an answer in seconds, and keep coding.

---

## ✨ What It Does

🎤 You ask a question about your code
🔍 It searches your actual codebase semantically
🔊 It responds in plain spoken English, like a senior dev sitting next to you

Example questions that work:
- "What does the preprocess function do?"
- "Where is the model saved after training?"
- "How do I debug a KeyError in the pipeline?"

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| 🎙️ [Vapi](https://vapi.ai/) | Handles voice input and output |
| 🗄️ [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) | Stores and searches code as vectors |
| 🤖 [Groq](https://groq.com/) (LLaMA 3.3 70B) | Generates the response |
| ⚡ [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) | Receives webhooks from Vapi and orchestrates everything |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- API keys for:
  - [Groq](https://console.groq.com/)
  - [Vapi](https://vapi.ai/)
  - [Qdrant](https://cloud.qdrant.io/) (cluster URL + API key)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (or similar tunneling tool) to expose your local server to Vapi

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aharshi3614/Devwhisper.git
   cd Devwhisper
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**

   Copy the example file and fill in your keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit `.env`:
   ```
   QDRANT_URL=your_qdrant_cluster_url
   QDRANT_API_KEY=your_qdrant_api_key
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   ```

5. **Add your codebase**

   Drop the Python files you want DevWhisper to answer questions about into the `sample_codebase/` folder.

6. **Index your codebase**
   ```bash
   python indexer.py
   ```

7. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root folder:`cp ./.env.example ./.env`

8. **Expose it publicly**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```

9. **Connect Vapi**

   Update your Vapi tool's Server URL to your ngrok URL plus `/webhook`.

### ✅ Verify it's working

With the server running, confirm it responds:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```
You should get a response back confirming the server is live. You can also run the standalone test client (see below) to check the full pipeline end-to-end without needing a live voice call.

---

## 🐳 Run with Docker

1. Build the image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t devwhisper .
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file with your API keys (same as above).
3. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env devwhisper
   ```
4. Expose it with ngrok and update your Vapi tool's Server URL as in the steps above.

---

## 🧪 Testing Locally

You can test DevWhisper's conversation flow directly from your terminal — without using Vapi or making a voice call — using the standalone test client. This is useful for local development and debugging.

1. Make sure your FastAPI server is running:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```
2. Run the test client in interactive mode:
   ```bash
   python test_client.py
   ```
3. Or pass a one-off query:
   ```bash
   python test_client.py --query "What does the preprocess function do?"
   ```

## 📁 Project Structure

| File / Folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main.py` | FastAPI webhook server, handles all Vapi events |
| `indexer.py` | Chunks your code files and uploads them to Qdrant |
| `retriever.py` | Takes a query and finds the most relevant code chunks |
| `llm.py` | Sends the query and context to Groq and returns the answer |
| `test_client.py` | Standalone CLI client for testing without Vapi |
| `sample_codebase/` | Put your own Python project files here |

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- The ngrok URL changes every time you restart it — remember to update the Server URL in your Vapi tool settings each time.
- The `.env` file is **not** included in this repo for security. Create your own using `.env.example` as a starting point.
